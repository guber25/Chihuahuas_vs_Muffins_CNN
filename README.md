# Chihuahuas vs Muffins Image Classifier üê∂üßÅ

In this repo you will find my work for the **Machine Learning exam** at UniMi which aims to create a good machine learning model to binary classify images of Chihuahuas and Muffins from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification). In particular, you will find both the code - with cut outputs to ensure readability - and the report in which I have widely explained the methodology and the steps taken to reach the final result. Still, the report was not the one presented at the exam. Indeed, I integrated it with many theoretical concepts useful to understand how the convolutional neural networks work.

The objective of this project is pursued through the implementation of **Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs) thanks to the Keras API of Tensorflow. After many tests and hyperparameter tuning, the final model was able to correctly classify around 9 pictures out of 10 as demonstrated by the 5-Fold Cross-Validation.

To guarantee reproducibility of results, I made available the final model in **.h5** format, feel free to download the file and to load it with Keras.

I am open to receive any feedback from you, enjoy! üíª
